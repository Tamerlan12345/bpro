## 2026-02-25 - Modal Accessibility
**Learning:** Modals often use `<span>` for close buttons, which are inaccessible to keyboard users. Replacing them with `<button>` and `aria-label` is a high-impact, low-effort fix.
**Action:** Always check modal close "buttons" for semantic HTML and keyboard accessibility.
